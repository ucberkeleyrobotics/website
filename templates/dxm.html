			<br><h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>With funding from UC Berkeley's <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/">College of Engineering</a> and Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society <a href="http://citris-uc.org/">(CITRIS)</a>, Robotics@Berkeley (R@B) is hosting an <b>eight week long robotics design competition</b> for Berkeley undergraduates from September to November 2016. In Dorm Ex Machina (translated "Dorm of the Machine"), selected teams will be advised by experienced R@B officers, funded by R@B's sponsors, and offered workshops and group work-sessions relevant to their projects. The winning design will be the robotic system that is most useful in college dorm-style living as judged by roboticists and ordinary college students at the culminating Dorm Ex Machina Pitch Night in November.</p>

			<h2>Competition Project Teams</h2>
			<p>Interested teams of 2-4 UC Berkeley students must <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/forms/d/1S_MCV7nRteP1xyAsLtLUm4T3Aaf5KF0BVwlHxSfWp6o/edit">apply</a> to be considered for participation. All accepted teams will receive an equal amount of funding upfront (on the order of $100); additional funds will be distributed to all teams as deemed appropriate. Participants will be expected to participate in the majority of Dorm Ex Machina and will likely need to work on their robots outside of designated Robotics@Berkeley events. Students competing in DXM will have many opportunities to network with other members of the robotics community here at Cal through regular Robotics@Berkeley activities.</p>

			<h2>Extensive Robotics Advising</h2>
			<p>DXM teams will be offered multiple different forms of project advising. All teams will meet with a Robotics@Berkeley officer in the first week of the competition to discuss their design plan and budgeting. In the first month of the competition, R@B will host at least three workshops on introductory robotics topics that will be useful for most, if not all, of the participating teams. Teams are encouraged to use the Arduino or Raspberry Pi platforms; a key theme throughout the competition will be how to find solutions when prototyping with these platforms both online and through different resources at UC Berkeley. In addition to workshops, R@B will host weekly work sessions where participants can get one-on-one robot advice from more experienced roboticists.</p>
