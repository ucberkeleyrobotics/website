			<br><h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>With funding from UC Berkeley's <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/">College of Engineering</a> and Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society <a href="http://citris-uc.org/">(CITRIS)</a>, Robotics@Berkeley (R@B) is hosting an <b>eight week long robotics design competition</b> for Berkeley undergraduates in Fall 2016. In Dorm Ex Machina (translated "Dorm of the Machine"), selected teams will be advised by experienced R@B officers, funded by R@B's sponsors, and offered workshops and group work-sessions relevant to their projects. The winning design will be the robotic system that is most useful in college dorm-style living as judged by roboticists and ordinary college students at the culminating Dorm Ex Machina Pitch Night in November.</p>

			<h2>Competition Project Teams</h2>
			<p>Interested teams of 2-4 UC Berkeley students must <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/forms/d/1S_MCV7nRteP1xyAsLtLUm4T3Aaf5KF0BVwlHxSfWp6o/edit">apply</a> to be considered for participation. All accepted teams will receive an equal amount of funding upfront (on the order of $100); additional funds will be distributed to all teams as deemed appropriate. Participants will be expected to participate in the majority of Dorm Ex Machina and will likely need to work on their robots outside of designated Robotics@Berkeley events. Students competing in DXM will have many opportunities to network with other members of the robotics community here at Cal through regular Robotics@Berkeley activities.</p>

			<h2>Extensive Robotics Advising</h2>
			<p>DXM teams will be offered multiple different forms of project advising. All teams will meet with a Robotics@Berkeley officer in the first week of the competition to discuss their design plan and budgeting. In the first month of the competition, R@B will host at least three workshops on introductory robotics topics that will be useful for most, if not all, of the participating teams. Teams are encouraged to use the Arduino or Raspberry Pi platforms; a key theme throughout the competition will be how to find solutions when prototyping with these platforms both online and through different resources at UC Berkeley. In addition to workshops, R@B will host weekly work sessions where participants can get one-on-one robot advice from more experienced roboticists.</p>

			<h2>Application</h2>
			<br>
			<p>We encourage all interested Berkeley undergraduates to apply. As robotics is a highly interdisciplinary field, we encourage applicants to strive for diversity in backgrounds and interests when forming teams. Decisions will be released shortly after the application deadline.</p>

			<p><b>Who can participate?</b></p>
			<p>This competition is exclusively for undergraduates registered at UC Berkeley for Fall 2016, visiting students
			studying at UC Berkeley in Fall 2016, and students in the Fall Program for Freshmen. </p><br><br>

			<p><b>How does the application process work?</b></p>
			<p>Groups of 2-4 students can apply to participate in DXM by completing the DXM application form by 11:59pm September 10, 2016. A separate application must be completed by each individual team member. All applications will be reviewed by a committee of Robotics@Berkeley officers. See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/forms/d/1S_MCV7nRteP1xyAsLtLUm4T3Aaf5KF0BVwlHxSfWp6o/edit">application</a> for more details.

			<p><b>What if I don't have a team?</b></p>
			<p>Students without a team are encouraged to attend Robotics@Berkeley's infosession on September 7, 2016 in The Woz. We will

			<p><b>What can I build?</b><p>
			<p>The objective of this competition is to build the most useful dorm automation device. Your design must include both software and hardware components. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x1GkgbVP1I">this automated dorm</a> for some examples.</p><br><br>

			<p><b>Where will I get parts for my design?</b><p>
			<p>Robotics@Berkeley will make a bulk order of common parts such as Arduinos, Wi-Fi modules, and jumper wires so that
			participants can purchase them at reduced price. More specific parts can either be purchased online at sources like Amazon
			or created at spaces on campus including Jacobs Hall, the CITRIS Invention Lab, and Bridges Makerspace.</p><br><br>

		<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
			<p><b>How much does this competition cost?</b></p>
			<p>Thanks to our generous sponsors, this competition is free for participants. All parts must be purchased with funds provided by Robotics@Berkeley; this both makes the competition free and guarantees a level playing field.</p><br><br>
