                        <p>As you may well know, UC Berkeley is a very exciting place for roboticists! There is an immense amount of cutting-edge robotics research here that constantly advances the broad and diverse fields that robotics spans. From self-driving cars to robotic surgery, intelligent laundry-folding robots to machines that mimic animal motions, the projects that Berkeley minds work on every day exceed many roboticistsâ€™ wildest dreams.</p>
