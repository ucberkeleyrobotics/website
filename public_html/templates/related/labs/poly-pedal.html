                        <p><b>Description:</b></p>
                        <p>The Poly-PEDAL (Performance, Energetics, Dynamics, Animal Locomotion) Lab researches the  movement of animals for applications towards improving the motion of robots. Their four primary areas of focus are biomechanics, muscles, energetics, and adhesion.</p>
                        <p>As stated by Professor Robert Full, his lab “quantifies whole animal performance in general and locomotion in particular as it relates to an animal’s structure, physiology, and behavior. ” Techniques such as computer simulation, physical modeling, muscle isolation, and field-tracking are used to study species that have developed their own interesting skeleton arrangements and movement.</p>
                        <p>The majority of robots behave “like a stool,” where legs must remain on the ground to retain stability. Animals like cockroaches and crabs have numerous legs that serve as a base of support with a low center of gravity; additionally all their legs need not be aerial while they navigate through various terrain, adding to their dynamic stability and flexible movements. His lab’s research provides the basis of inspiration for the design of multi-legged robots.</p>
